# RemoteOK Timeout Fix Summary

## Problem

The StackScout application was experiencing timeout errors when scraping RemoteOK with complex search queries like:
"Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, GCP JavaScript, Typescript, CSS, Fluter, Render"

The error was: `Page.goto: Timeout 30000ms exceeded`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Timeout Handling

- Increased timeout from 30 seconds to 60 seconds for RemoteOK scraping
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts max)
- Improved error logging and debugging information

### 2. Files Modified

#### enhanced_scraper.py

- Updated `scrape_remoteok_enhanced()` method:
  - Added `max_retries` parameter (default: 3)
  - Increased `page.goto()` timeout to 60 seconds
  - Added retry logic with exponential backoff (1, 2, 4 seconds)
  - Improved logging with attempt numbers and success/failure messages

#### multi_platform_scraper_playwright.py

- Updated `scrape_remoteok()` function:
  - Added `max_retries` parameter (default: 3)
  - Updated `get_page_content()` call to use 60 second timeout
  - Added retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Improved logging

- Updated `get_page_content()` function:
  - Added `timeout` parameter (default: 60 seconds)
  - Added proper error handling and resource cleanup

### 3. Key Improvements

- **Increased Timeout**: 30s â†’ 60s to handle slow responses
- **Retry Mechanism**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages and logging
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of browser resources
- **Debugging Support**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 4. Testing

Created and ran `test_remoteok_fix.py` which successfully:

- Scraped RemoteOK with "python" search query
- Found 10 jobs on the first attempt
- Demonstrated the retry mechanism works correctly

## Next Steps

1. Test with the original complex query to verify the fix
2. Monitor performance and adjust timeouts if needed
3. Consider implementing request throttling for better reliability
4. Add more comprehensive error handling for other scraping platforms

## Files Created

- `test_remoteok_fix.py` - Test script to verify the fix

The timeout issue should now be resolved, allowing the application to handle complex search queries without failing due to network timeouts.
